      Why Blogging?
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
      Reading exposes us to ideas beyond our own experience. Building turns
      those ideas into reality. I blog to connect the two by documenting what I
      learn while working on technology, systems, and software, so the thinking
      behind the code is never lost.
